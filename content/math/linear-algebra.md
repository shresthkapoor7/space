vector - it's like an arrow pointing, with the tail sitting at the origin.

how they look →
$begin:math:display$
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}
$end:math:display$
coordinate system tells you how far to move along the x, y, and z axes.

**vector addition** - move the tail of one vector to the tip of another.
then draw a line from the tail of the first to the tip of the second - that's the sum. basic stuff, pff.

```python
# update
```

**multiply by scalar / scaling** - stretches or shrinks the vector by a constant factor.


some fancy lingo: **span** - the set of all linear combinations
$begin:math:display$
a \vec{v} + b \vec{w}
$end:math:display$
so span is like: where can we go using those vectors?


**redundant vector / linearly dependent** - if one vector is just a scaled version of another.
This restricts the span.
in 2D, it would only give you a **line** instead of covering the whole **plane**.


**basis** - the holy origin for vectors.
Usually $begin:math:text$\hat{i}$end:math:text$ and $begin:math:text$\hat{j}$end:math:text$, the unit vectors in x and y direction.



### linear transformations

think of them as functions:
they take in a vector and spit out another vector.

suppose you have a vector:
$begin:math:display$
\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}
$end:math:display$
and you wish to transform it.

but instead of transforming $begin:math:text$\vec{v}$end:math:text$ directly,
you transform the **basis vectors** $begin:math:text$\hat{i}$end:math:text$ and $begin:math:text$\hat{j}$end:math:text$.

**example:**
imagine you want to rotate a vector by **90°**.
instead of rotating the vector, you rotate the **entire base** by 90°.

like the harry potter stairs...
you don't move - you're pointing the same way - but the **stair rotates** beneath you, and now you're pointing somewhere else.

mathematically, what you're doing is multiplying the vector by a **transformation matrix** - built from the rotated basis vectors. for a 90° counterclockwise rotation, the matrix is:

$begin:math:display$
R_{90°} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
$end:math:display$

then:

$begin:math:display$
\vec{v}_{\text{rotated}} = R_{90°} \cdot \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
$end:math:display$

which gives you the rotated vector.
